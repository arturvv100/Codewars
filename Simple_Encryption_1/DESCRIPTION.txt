DESCRIPTION:

Implement a pseudo-encryption algorithm which given a string S and an integer N concatenates all the odd-indexed characters of S with all the even-indexed characters of S, this process should be repeated N times.
ogether with the encryption function, you should also implement a decryption function which reverses the process.

If the string S is an empty value or the integer N is not positive, return the first argument without changes.
